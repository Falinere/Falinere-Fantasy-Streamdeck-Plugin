# Falinere Fantasy Stream Deck Plugin

Interact with Falinere Fantasy with the Elgato Stream Deck!

## Description

With this plugin, you perform some actions within the game:

- Join Battle -- This only works if you've already sent a message with the game open. Keeps you from having to use the join command
- Choose Dungeon -- Enters the dungeon of your choice from the Dungeon Select Menu
- Skip Turn -- Skips the current players turn (also useful for bypassing a bug that freezes the turn)
- Relay Website -- Posts the website for the game into your stream chats
- Leave Combat -- Removes you from combat (if you need to open a spot for players or need to step away from the keyboard for a while)

### Installation

Run the `falfan.streamDeckPlugin` installer to load the plugin into your Elgato Stream Deck software.

For the `Join Battle` and `Choose Dungeon` buttons, you'll need to select their respective dropdown menus and choose an option. All other buttons can just be edited with a text label to customize it.
